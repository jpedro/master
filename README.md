Deterministic password generator.

Inspired by [spectre.app](https://spectre.app/) but simpler.

This uses a sha256 hashed combination of `username + password + service`
to generate the same password, over and over again, thus eliminating
the need to store, maintain and back up other generated passwords.

The used service name list is kept under the file `~/.config/master/list.txt`
(or whatever `MASTER_LIST` points to) *purely for autocompletion*,
which will be added later.


## Install

    pip install masterpass

Yes, yes. The package is called `masterpass` but the binary is called
`master`. To be fixed after [#2582](https://github.com/pypi/support/issues/2582)
is resolved.


## Usage

```
$ master --help

NAME
    master -- Generates deterministic passwords for services

USAGE
    master NAME                 Gets the password for service NAME
    master -l, --list           Lists all stored services
    master -r, --remove NAME    Removes service NAME from the stored list
    master -v, --version        Shows the version
    master -h, --help           Shows this help

```
